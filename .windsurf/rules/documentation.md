description: when working with the air package or with Huggingface
---

- You should always verify things are being done correctly by checking the documentation of air, which you have tools to inspect.  The best developers reference the documentation a lot.
- The air docs are great, you should always look for things in the docs directory to learn about air vs the source code when possible.
- You must always check the file `HW1/demo/3. BetterContext/context/hf_inference_quickstart.md` and `HW1/demo/3. BetterContext/context/hf_inferenceclient.md` when working with Hugging Face inference endpoint.
- A simple example of using the Hugging Face inference client with the Flux text-to-image model hosted on Hugging Face is given in the file `HW1/demo/3. BetterContext/context/hf_inference_flux.md`. Use this example as a starting point when using the Flux model to create images.
- You must always check the file `HW1/demo/3. BetterContext/context/hf_gradioclient.md` when using Gradio and when using the Gradio API.
